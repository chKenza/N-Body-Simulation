# N-Body-Simulation
 Simulating the dynamics of several bodies moving simultaneously under the influence of gravity forces.

 Use ./nbody or ./nbody -sim1 to simulate the solar system (by default)

 Use ./nbody -sim3 to simulate a 3 body problem

 [TODO] Use ./nbody -sim6 to simulate a 6 body problem

 Use ./nbody -comp to compare the sequential and the conccurent approaches' results

 Use ./nbody -rand N with N a number of bodies

 Use ./nbody -help to see all call options
